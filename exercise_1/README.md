## Overview

The goal of this lab is to introduce the process of setting up a model workflow and adding a recipe.

This lab accompanies [7. A model workflow](https://www.tmwr.org/workflows.html) and [8. Feature Engineering with recipes](https://www.tmwr.org/recipes.html) from [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/).

## Instructions

After creating your own GitHub repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L03_model_workflows.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L03.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
