## Overview

This project aims to accomplish two prediction goals, referred to as Exercise 1 and Exercise 2.

#### Exercise 1

In Exercise 1, we work with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)), consisting of 4,177 observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about 25% of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone. Our goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. 

The full abalone data set is located in the `data/` subdirectory. For more information on the `data/` subdirectory, refer to its `README.me` file. 

#### Exercise 2

For this exercise, we work with part of a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) that was the subject of a machine learning competition and is often used for practicing ML models.

The goal is classification; specifically, to predict which passengers would survive the [Titanic shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic).

The full titanic data set is located in the `data/` subdirectory. For more information on the `data/` subdirectory, refer to its `README.me` file. 

## Repository Setup

All files related to Exercise 1 can be found in the `exercise_1/` subdirectory. For more information on the `exercise_1/` subdirectory, refer to its `README.me` file. 

All files related to Exercise 2 can be found in the `exercise_2/` subdirectory. For more information on the `exercise_2/` subdirectory, refer to its `README.me` file. 

The `images/` subdirectory contains all images used in this project.

Other files include:

- `L04_judging_models.html`: the instructions for the creation of this project as a part of STAT 301-2, a course taken in Winter 2024 at Northwestern University
- `model_practice.html` and `model_practice.qmd`: the (rendered) project report
